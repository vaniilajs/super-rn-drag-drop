title: "useEvent"
---

`useEvent` is a custom React Hook to define an event handler with a function identity that is always stable.

The event handler will be referentially the same during each re-render. Essentially, the event handler will have the following properties:

- The function will not be recreated each time prop or state changes

- The function will have access to the latest value of both the prop and state

## Usage

```tsx
const SomeComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState(0);

  const handleEvent = useEvent(() => {
    console.log(`log some state: `, someState);
  });

  // Render component content
};
```
